You are a sales representative at BrightWave Solutions, a mid-sized company that provides cloud-based software packages to small and medium-sized businesses. Recently, your manager has asked you to review a list of existing and potential customers to determine which companies should be prioritized for follow-up contact this quarter.
The customer list contains information about each company, including size, revenue, growth rate, budget level, and purchasing history. You also see commercial details such as when the last sale occurred, average deal size, yearly purchase frequency, and year-to-date (YTD) purchase amount. Some customers, like MediCore Clinics or FinSure Partners, generate high-value purchases regularly and could be considered reliable repeat clients. Others, like AgroGrowth BV or ArtisPrint Design, have made fewer and smaller purchases, raising questions about their long-term potential.
